            <h1>Ōkunoshima – Japan‘s Poison Factory</h1>
            <p>In World War II, Japan produced an estimated amount of 9000 tons of chemical weapons in the poison gas
                factory on Ōkunoshima. Today it‘s globally known as rabbit island: Around 700 free hopping rabbits
                attract hundreds of thousands of tourists.</p>
                <h3> The documentary „Ōkunoshima“ shows what‘s left of the poison gas – and that it‘s still </h3>

                <h3>About the documentary „Ōkunoshima“</h3>
                <p>The 30 minute documentary film was independently researched and produced between 2013 and 2019. It
                    combined unpublished documents, interviews with victims & historical witnesses, as well as unseen
                    images from various archives from around the world. The documentary had its world premiere at the
                    Hiroshima International Film Festival in 2019 and was nominated in the category “Investigative
                    Medium” for the 2020 DIG Awards.</p>

                <h3>About the filmmaker Fritz Schumann</h3>
                <p>I‘m a visual journalist working in Japan since 2009. In 2013, when I was living in Hiroshima, I
                    started to research the history of Ōkunoshima beyond the rabbit island fame. I was shocked by the
                    extent of the production and how unknown the poison gas history was even inside Japan. Besides a
                    research grant, this film was funded by myself. It was challenging to find sources and the research
                    took me several years – and it will stick with me for a long time. Some of the people I talked to
                    have already passed away, it was their last chance to tell me their story. I hope this documentary
                    film can preserve their memories for the future.</p>
